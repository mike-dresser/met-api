# met-api

Phase 1 Project - an interface to the API of the Metropolitan Museum of Art

##MVP:

Mike and I have decided to take an Artistic approach to this phase-1 project. We Conceptualization Information HUB of the MET museum collection.

The website would pull data via API from MET to show users information about the art, this includes the current location of where the artwork is on display, the time/year when the artwork was created, the painter, and the country of origin for the artwork.

##Technical:
-The SPA would have a main image when the page loads, the image would randomly change every time the user loads the page.
-Under this, the page would have 4-5 different drop-down boxes that are programmed to search a topic quickly ie Country, period, Painting type etc.
-Search feature, the user can use a search input box to search for what painting, or artifact they are looking for.
-The last container would be a save/favorite container, where users can save their paintings for themselves.

##Resources:
For the main API, we are using the MET API, to pull data to various params.
The webpage will also be using a db.json server on a local machine, this is where a user can save the painting to their "favorite" container.

##Stretch Goal :
A stretch goal for us is to create a carousel-like container to have random photos rotating on the landing page, this would replace the main image on the page
